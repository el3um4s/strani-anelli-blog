I’ll resume the discussion from the other day. Although it’s not a perfect book, Katalin Karikó’s autobiography is one of the most beautiful and interesting things I’ve read recently. Not so much for the scientific aspect, undoubtedly interesting, but for some... let’s say "advice" that can be gleaned from her story. I’ve gathered some of the passages that struck me the most.

### 1. The  brain  is  malleable.  What  we  practice,  we strengthen.

> Even  in  first  grade,  in  second  grade,  I  worked  so  hard.  I  tried  to  do everything correctly. If it wasn’t right, I started over again.  
> I worked.  
> I worked.  
> I worked.  
> And  it  turns  out  that  the  brain  is  malleable.  What  we  practice,  we strengthen. I practiced being an excellent student—it was an active practice, the way an aspiring athlete might shoot baskets. Like an athlete, I got better.  
> School  became  more  natural  to  me.  By  third  grade,  I  had  dived  so completely  into  school  that  I  earned  straight  5s  all  the  way,  and  I  never looked back.  
> Nor, I’ll say, did I ever stop practicing.  

### 2. Sometimes bullshit men are lauded as heroes

> ONCE ,  IN   ELEMENTARY   SCHOOL ,  we  were  given  a  history  assignment:  to interview an older community member, someone who stood out as a local hero. Each of us was to take an oral history, gather the subject’s memories, then write a laudatory essay based on what we had heard. I was tasked with interviewing a veteran, a man about my father’s age.  
> My father asked the name. When I told him, I saw something dark cross my father’s eyes. “That is a bad man,” he said. I almost never heard my father’s voice like that. Hard. Angry.  
> “That man was cruel,” my father continued. “He is a bullshit man, and this interview will be bullshit.”  
> I still don’t know what my father knew about this man, or what he’d seen. But I took this in. Then I did what I had to. I interviewed the man, collected his memories, and wrote my glowing essay. But I did so havinglearned a truth: That some tasks are bullshit. That my subject was a bullshit man. That sometimes bullshit men are lauded as heroes.  

### 3. Questions in the form of experiments

> It is also that Selye somehow understands *how I want to think*, the way I want to define a big question, then begin zeroing in, systematically and logically, on clear and specific answers. Early in the book, Selye notes that nature “rarely replies to questions unless they are put to her in the form of experiments,  to  which  she  can  say  yes  or  no.”  I  read  this  line  again and again: *questions…in the form of experiments…she can say yes or no*. One question  at  a  time.  From  many  such  questions,  from  many  yes-or-no answers, a mosaic grows.


### 4. There's almost always just one more thing

> And  not  just  because  Columbo  is—as  I  will  be  soon—a  fish  out  of water amid powerful people. (They’ll look right through me, those people. Again  and  again,  they’ll  fail  to  notice  that  my  mind,  too,  is  taking everything in.) But rather because of that line: *Just one more thing*.
> Here’s the truth: Scientific investigation can be tedious. It generates a lot  of  data,  and  sometimes  the  bulk  of  that  data  appears  to  point  in  one direction.  It  can  be  tempting  to  look  for  the  data  that  fit  one’s  existing narrative, and when you find that data—which you will—to feel that you’ve done your job.
> But you must do your experiments correctly.
> You ask one question at a time. Then you change just one variable and ask again. And then you change the next variable. And then the next. *Just one more thing*. There’s almost always just one more thing.

### 5. You  should  know  about  things  fellow  scientists  are  doing

> “*You are going to be a scientist,*” János said, interrupting my thoughts.
> “*You  should  know  about  things  fellow  scientists  are  doing  and  have something to say.*”

### 6. That’s the thing about potential: It always begins as nothing.

> *Each  of  those  obstacles  would  always  be  more  tangible  than contributions  I  hadn’t  yet  made.*  Obstacles  have  shape  and  structure;  you can  see  them.  One’s  future  impact,  by  contrast,  remains  invisible, hypothetical, at least until the future finally arrives.  
> Nobody would ever knock on my door and say, “Kati, this world needs the research you haven’t done, the discoveries you haven’t yet made.” My contributions, at this point, didn’t exist. That’s the thing about potential: It always begins as nothing. And if that empty space was ever to be filled in, if it was ever to become **something**, it would be up to me.  
> I returned to work, and from that moment forward, I kept my pace up. No matter how sick I felt, I kept going. I never allowed myself to back off.  

### 7. Experiments never err, only your expectations do

> Sometimes  when  an  experiment  didn’t  provide  the  results  I’d anticipated,  I  glanced  at  a  quote  hanging  on  the  wall,  from  Leonardo da Vinci: *Experiments never err, only your  expectations do*. It might seem that an experiment fails, but that’s only because your hypothesis was wrong or because  you  made  an  experimental  error.  Unless  you  do  many  different experiments,  each  time  adjusting  a  little  something,  you  can’t  possibly know.

### 8. An individual experiment it is not in itself research

> While  an  individual  experiment  is  the  smallest  possible  unit  of  the research  process,  it  is  not  in  itself  *research*.  In  science,  your  overarching goal is to develop and test hypotheses; to do this, you need results not from one single experiment but rather from a mountain of them. You need to do each  experiment  many  different  times,  each  time  changing  only  one variable. For each experiment, you also need control studies, in which no variables are changed, so you have a point of comparison.

### 9. Gratitude amplifies those things on which a successful life depends

> That night, after hanging up the phone, I’d said to Béla, *Would it be so hard to be grateful?*
> It is an important question.  
> Near the very end of *The Stress of Life*, the book that had so moved me as  a  high  school  student,  Selye  thinks  carefully  about  two  mutually exclusive  responses  to  stress  in  human  relations:  revenge  and  gratitude. Revenge,  he  notes,  is  an  attempt  to  relieve  stress.  It  is  a  very  human response  to  a  threat  to  one’s  security.  But  revenge,  he  observes,  “has  no virtue  whatever,  and  can  only  hurt  both  the  giver  and  the  receiver  of  its fruits.” Revenge brings only more revenge, in an endless cycle. If the goal is  to  relieve  stress  in  a  way  that  *enhances*  one’s  life,  rather  than  detracts from it, there is a better way: One can be grateful.  
> Gratitude,  Selye  explains,  is  also  cumulative.  Like  revenge,  it  brings ever  more  of  itself.  But  the  place  where  it  leads  is  entirely  different. Gratitude amplifies those things on which a successful life depends: peace of mind, security, fulfillment.  
> Would it be so hard to be grateful? The truth is, no. It is rarely so hard. One can find the good even in situations that end badly. One can always find a way to say thank you.  

### 10. It matters, having your own personal cheerleader

> Still, I’d do it all again if I could: the cheering, the pom-poms, every loud, embarrassing moment. I think it matters, having your own personal cheerleader.  I  think  everyone  deserves  to  know,  *Here  is  someone  who believes in me. Here is someone who believes I can do great things, and who will never, ever quit rooting for me.*

### 11. Having lots of options might be its own sort of burden

> When  I’d  first  met  David,  I’d  understood  that  he  would  be  given abundant opportunities. Now I wondered if having lots of options might be its own sort of burden. If many doors are open to you, but you can walkthrough  only  a  handful  in  one  lifetime,  do you  live  forever  haunted  by what-ifs?

### 12. May  immigrants  keep  coming

> May  immigrants  keep  coming.  May  they  continue  aspiring  to  more, going wherever they must to get the opportunities they deserve. May they keep making their way, and in the process remake our world.

### 13. You are the potential, you are the seed

> Your future contribution might still be hypothetical. Please treat it like it’s real. It matters. It matters even if you don’t get to see the impact. That’s not the part any of us gets to control. Just keep going with your one more thing, and your one more thing, and your one more thing after that.
> Something I know for sure is this: Every seed gives rise to new life. This life in turn produces new seeds, which in turn give rise to still more. On and on it goes.  
> What I’m saying is, you must trust what’s inside you. Nurture what you find there, even — especially — when no one else does. What I’m saying is, keep going. Keep growing. Keep moving toward the light.  
> You are the potential. You are the seed.
