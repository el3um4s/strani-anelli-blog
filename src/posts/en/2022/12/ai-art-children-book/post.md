For several weeks now, I have been using images generated by Artificial Intelligences to illustrate my articles. I have realized that I prefer colorful images with a kawaii style. Based on this assumption, I wondered if there was another style that suited me. I therefore decided to explore the world of children's book illustrators a bit. In this post, I report on my experiments, hoping that they may be useful to someone.

### Who are the most famous children's illustrators?

I must admit that I am not an expert. In fact, I am definitely out of my comfort zone. But by searching online, I found some lists. So I can report the names of some illustrators who seemed the most interesting to me:

1. Jon Klassen
2. Toni Pagot
3. John Tenniell
4. Richard Scarry
5. Eric Carle
6. Mo Willems
7. Chris Haughton
8. Oliver Jeffers

Well, now I have a list of artists to take inspiration from.

### Conclusion

These are the images I got from my experiments. The interesting thing is that the style recalls, more or less, the style by the original illustrators. However, Iâ€™m not completely satisfied. Some of the pictures are fascinating but not all of them. I think there is much to improve, starting with the prompts. For example, if I choose an in-depth prompt, I get more intriguing images:
