subtitle: Scattered notes on how to improve your reasoning skills starting from Sherlock Holmes's novels
---
A few days ago, my wife recommended a book on how the mind works, how to reason better, and how to sharpen one's mental skills. Unlike other books on the same subject, Massimo Polidoro - a famous scientific popularizer - starts from the novels of Sherlock Holmes to address what the mind is, what scientific reasoning is, and what we can do to make the best use of our abilities.

It's a very interesting book, full of food for thought. Here is the table of contents of the book and some notes. As soon as I have some time, I will organize the notes better and discuss them in more depth.

- Title: **Sherlock Holmes and the Art of Reasoning**

### Scattered Notes

- We are not thinking machines that get emotional, but emotional machines that think
- You see, but you do not observe. That is the whole difference
- To create a false myth often just a cocktail of cognitive distortions, wishful thinking, and a pinch of truth is enough
- The brain plans and that's it, however its agents are numerous and wonderfully organized
- From an evolutionary point of view, the current human brain is the result of the overlap of three "types of brain"
- System 1 operates quickly, automatically, instinctively. System 2 uses attention and concentration
- Halo Effect, first impression bias
- The individual is necessarily subjugated by an irrationality more powerful than any form of self-control
- Confirmation bias, hindsight bias, blind spot bias
- Presumption of Honesty and Error Management Theory
- As human beings, we are subject to error, it is part of our nature
- Humility absorbs experience and converts it into wisdom, arrogance is a screen against which experience bounces leaving
- ignorance
- Being humble means having your roots planted on the ground. It's the only way to grow lush instead of withering and dying
- Confident humility. Because only when mistakes are always new are we learning new things
- Multitasking is not good
- Forgetting the details allows us to acquire concepts and imagine the future
- Knowledge, Observation, Deduction
- Deduction vs Induction vs Abduction
- Bias of "it's always been done this way" and "everyone does it this way"
- Learning to reason by cultivating doubts
- The problem with humanity is that stupid people are always very sure, while intelligent people are full of doubts
- Sunk cost fallacy - it is foolish to persevere in wrong choices
- Sherlock Holmes' secret talent is his willingness to be wrong
- The most painful regrets are about something we chose not to do
