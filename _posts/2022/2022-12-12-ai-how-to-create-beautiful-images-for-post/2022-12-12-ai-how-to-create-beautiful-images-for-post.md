Over the past few weeks, I've written a lot of posts about JavaScript. I realized that the images available online to illustrate mathematical and IT concepts are always the same. That's why I decided to illustrate my stories with AI-generated images.

There are various possibilities. I decided to use a cheap solution ([Lexica.art](https://medium.com/data-driven-fiction/lexica-art-how-to-search-and-create-images-with-artificial-intelligence-58ca51e63394)) and to keep a uniform style. I'm not a designer, so I don't want to spend too much time on this. I just want to have a nice image to illustrate my posts.

### Kawai Cute Little

Of all the variants, my favorite is to use `kawai cute little` as keywords. In this way I obtain delicate images, with rounded strokes and warm colours. It's an effect I like. Let's try some examples.

If I want to plot a graph, I can use a prompt like this:

```
kawai cute little representation of bar graph on a wall, beautiful light. soft colour scheme, 8 k render
```

{% include picture img="cute-chart.webp" ext="jpg" alt="" %}

If I want to represent a series of letters instead I can try:

```
kawai cute little alphabet, beautiful light. soft colour scheme, 8 k render
```

{% include picture img="cute-word.webp" ext="jpg" alt="" %}

Finally if I'm interested in an image with numbers:

```
kawai cute little representation of numbers, beautiful light. soft colour scheme, 8 k render
```

{% include picture img="cute-numbers.webp" ext="jpg" alt="" %}

Once you have found a style it is interesting to use it for several posts, in order to give a homogeneous effect. For example I can also try with these styles (by the way, I recommend reading [this story](https://exquisiteworkers.medium.com/32-art-styles-on-midjourney-v4-you-must-try-e1844e75daf3) by [Exquisite Workers](https://exquisiteworkers.medium.com/)).
