Today I want to be inspired by [a story by Stella Sky](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/i-asked-ai-what-is-love-midjourney-answered-1c2caac68961). She asked Midjourney what love was. A simple question. But it is also a question that touches the individual emotional sphere. It's a question that many have tried to answer, and to which there is no right or wrong answer.

Stella asked the AI ​​to represent love in 3 different ways:

1. text prompt: “Love”
2. text prompt: “What is love?”
3. text prompt: “Loved you yesterday, love you still, always have, always will.”

I want to follow the same plot. But of course I will try to steer the results towards something different.
