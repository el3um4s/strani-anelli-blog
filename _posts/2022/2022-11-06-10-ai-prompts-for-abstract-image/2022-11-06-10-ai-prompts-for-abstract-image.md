My artistic experiments with Artificial Intelligence continue. These days I have created some geometric images. These are some of the prompts I liked the most. But why do it?

For two reasons. The first is curiosity. I am interested in how this drawing technique works, to face some more ambitious projects in the future. But also because I like the sense of order that a geometric image conveys. Although AI isn't always rigorous.

Secondly, I am thinking of adding some images to the links shared via my side project ([docrypt](https://docrypt.org/)). I like the idea of ​​having a different image for each message. Using AI to generate these images seems like a good idea to me. But I'll talk about this in another post.
