When creating images with Artificial Intelligences, one of the most difficult things to understand is how to use the various words within the prompt. I suspect there are similarities with writing code. But while, for example, JavaScript follows known laws, the rules of AI are a little harder to understand. Someone will eventually write a complete treatise, but for now I have to make do with trial and error.

Obviously, I am not the only one experimenting with AI. For example, [The Jasper Whisperer](https://www.thejasperwhisperer.com/jasperartcheatsheet) has published several guides on the subject. And then there are the posts by [Salvatore Raieli](https://salvatore-raieli.medium.com/), which are very interesting and full of food for thought. And, of course, many others.

That said, today I am testing Jasper Art. I want to see how the images change if I change the basic settings. In this post I will keep track of the generated images. Starting with the first, which will be the base for my tests: an apple.

```
An Apple in a table
```

{% include picture img="apple.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table" %}

The generated image is beautiful. It represents, and it represents a good starting point. Starting from this image, I try to add some features. First of all, I try modifying the medium on which the image appears. The basic options of Jasper Art are those common to all AI:

- acrylic paint
- chalk
- collage
- graffiti
- ink
- mixed media
- oil paint
- photography
- tempera paint
- watercolor

I then proceed to modify the prompt by adding one of these mediums at a time. For example, to try the 'acrylic paint' medium, I add to the prompt:

```
An Apple in a table, acrylic paint
```

### Acrylic Paint

{% include picture img="apple-acrylic.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table, acrylic paint" %}

Well, now I'll try with the other options.

### Chalk

```
An Apple in a table, chalk
```

{% include picture img="apple-chalk.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table, chalk" %}

### Collage

```
An Apple in a table, collage
```

{% include picture img="apple-collage.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table, collage" %}

### Graffiti

```
An Apple in a table, graffiti
```

{% include picture img="apple-graffiti.webp" ext="jpg" alt="The drawing of an apple on a wall as if it were a graffiti" %}

### Ink

```
An Apple in a table, ink
```

{% include picture img="apple-ink.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table, ink" %}

### Mixed Media

```
An Apple in a table, mixed media
```

{% include picture img="apple-mixed.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table, mixed media" %}

### Oil Paint

```
An Apple in a table, oil paint
```

{% include picture img="apple-oil.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table, oil paint" %}

### Photography

```
An Apple in a table, photography
```

{% include picture img="apple-photography.webp" ext="jpg" alt="An Apple in a table, photography" %}

### Tempera Paint

```

### Watercolor
