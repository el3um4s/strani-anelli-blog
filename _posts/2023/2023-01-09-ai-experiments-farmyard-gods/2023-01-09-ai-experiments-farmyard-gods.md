My family has often dealt with mythology and deities. Although I consider myself an atheist, I have remained curious about religions, traditions, deities, and other things. Over time, I have developed a certain passion for urban fantasy stories, like those by Neil Gaiman. I would like to write something similar, maybe set in Milan. For now, however, I am still in the exploration phase and I enjoy playing with ideas and concepts.

The post today is exactly about one of these games. I wanted to imagine a pantheon of deities based on farm animals. It is not my intention to create a religion, obviously, but only to play with the concept of how common, sometimes underestimated, animals can be a source of inspiration for a mythology. Here are my "Farmyard Gods".

But before starting with the list and images, a couple of notes on the method I followed. To create the images I used an Artificial Intelligence (Jasper). I asked another Artificial Intelligence (ChatGPT) to add a power to the various deities.
